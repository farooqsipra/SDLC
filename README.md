## What is SDLC?

**Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** is a structured approach used to develop high-quality software in a systematic and cost-effective way. This lifecycle defines stages and deliverables at each point in the development process.

## SDLC Phases & Descriptions

### Requirement Gathering & Analysis

- Collect functional and non-functional requirements.
- 
- Stakeholder interviews, brainstorming, and documentation.
- 
### Planning

- Define scope, resources, budget, and timelines.

- Create a project roadmap and risk assessment plan.

### Design

- High-Level Design (HLD): Architecture, tech stack.

- Low-Level Design (LLD): Component details, database schemas.

### Development / Implementation

- Code development by engineers according to design specs.

- Unit testing is typically performed here.

### Testing

- Execute test cases (unit, integration, system, user acceptance).

- Log, fix, and re-test bugs.

### Deployment

- Release the software to production.

- Could be done in phases (canary/blue-green deployment).

### Maintenance

- Monitor the software in production.

- Provide updates, patches, or feature enhancements.
